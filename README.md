# masterthesis
My master thesis project, some files and programs were used for some quick testing and are not necessarily relevant. As this repository was not originally intended to be published, some files are rather chaotic, but will be cleaned up for in the coming weeks. The main file is measure.sh. The svm address is to access the Redfish interface for the power measurements. CPU utilisation is calculated by taking the non-idle CPU time, and RAM and SWAP memory are taken using the free command.
